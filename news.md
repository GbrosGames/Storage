<size=18>2022-11-19 The current state of things</size>

We are working hard on our combat system for quite some time now - so please let us know what you think!

Currently, builds are not about the amount of content yet! We are all about combat gameplay and game feel in general:

- Is playing enjoyable?
- Is combat satisfying and engaging?
- Is there anything that does not feel right?

Your opinion matters, feel free to reach out and share your thoughts!
